The main purpose of this project is generally simple but effective to create and interactive guide website who wants to get short and quick information about the city by prezenting main attractions, accomodation and gastronomy facilities, displayed on the map, where the visitors can search for interesting them options. It will also present the main attractions of Wroclaw, the family of small dwarfs, that have been settled in Wroclaw for good, which can be a great activity not only for children but also for adults trying to find them all while exploring this amazing city.

- The first page will consist of a large hero image amd an animated welcome sign will appear after loading page and also navigation bar which is transparent will change to dark after scroll so the user can see the full image first.
- The second about page will contain information about the city, the story about the dwarf and also useful information about the Polish currency and the current weather in Poland. At the end of the page there will be an interactive gallery of dwarf's.

**CONTACT PAGE**

- Pages/Section: Home, About, Attractions, Contact
- Fixed footer with Social Media icons oppened in a new tab.
- Fixed navigation bar primary transparent changes to Ritch Black  as the user starts to scroll down the page 
- Menu headings and pointing to each of the 4 Pages


**5. Surface**
**Colors**
- When choosing the colors, I wanted to refer to the white and red Polish flag and. Cinnabar is the current color of the flag and to which I have chosen a slightly more subdued shade of white and complemented it with shades of black and gray, which will give a website a balanced contrast. 
- As a primary color, I have chosen the color Ritch Black FORGA 39 (0E0E10) which has some small tonal changes from a normal black color and it will be used for navigation bar, footer and font-color of the website. 
- As an additional color, I chose Cinnabar (E34234) which I will be used for buttons and ON/OFF Switch used for reversing buttons. That color will make the important things like contact/sent buttons pop, so it will be noticed by the user immediately.
 - For the background I have chosen a Lavender Gray (C7C7D1) and for text on navbar and footer I have chosen off-white named Cultured (F4F4F6). Both colors belongs to the same color palette as Ritch Black FORGA 39. This colors also works very well with the images.

  ![altcolorspalette](wireframes/testing/color-palette.png)
 

 **Typography**
- For the main headings, logo "WROCLAW" and the sign "The city of Dwarfs" I selected the "Just Another Hand" font with the group of fall-back font of "Cursive". It will add to the website a simplicity which I felt will suits the look of the website. I also have chosen this font to make the favicon logo for the tab.
- For the content I have chosen "Lato" with fallback of "sans-serif", which was created by a polish designer and due to it's populatity this is a font that many users will be familiar with evoking a feeling of trust as well as being pleasing. It is a popular pairing font with "Just Another Hand" according to [google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Just+Another+Hand?query=just+&preview.text=WROCLAW%20The%20City%20Of%20Dwarfs&preview.text_type=custom#pairings/)


 **Images**
- The image selection has been chosen very carefuly to present the beauty of this city and the main attraction of the city Dwarfs which are settled for good in Wroclaw. The presentation of photos shows potential tourists the attractiveness of the city
- The hero image was chosen to give the site a little bit fairy-tale character. 
The idea came from here to present the main attractions of this city, which are dwarfs, fairy-tale scenery.
