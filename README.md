## UX
---
This website design will target tourists of all ages, families with children and friends who are looking for the next city break destination,
 as those intedend to visit Poland. The main purpose of this project was to create and interactive guide website with easy and quick access to
 information about the city by prezenting main attractions, accomodation and gastronomy facilities, displayed on the map, where visitors can search 
 the options of their interest. It will present the main attractions of Wroclaw, the family of small dwarfs that have settled in Wroclaw for good.
 It can be a great activity not only for children but also for adults who may want to find them all while exploring this amazing city.

**1. Strategy**

My goal for this project is to promote the Wroclaw as the next city break destination and increase the interest of tourist activity.
 It is intended to be used as an interactive guide to help navigate through the attractions, restaurants, pubs, accomodation through 
 the UX simple, clean and user-friendly site design. 
 
### Project purpose:
- To create easier trip planning to Wroclaw , by providing useful and helpfull information about the city.
- To promote places which are great for short term destination but may not always be concidered.

### Site owner goals:
- Promote Wroclaw and encourage tourists to visit and explore this lovely city.
- Provide a usefull information about the city and demonstrate various activities, accomodation, and places to eat 
  which may suit the visitors needs and budget. 
- Provide the contact form, so the users be able to get in touch with their queries in relation to their trip.
- Include user friendly map with various attractions, accomodations and gastronomy facilities.

- The purpose of the Structure has been created as a single page website containing sections for each page and enables users to quickly navigate through the website, 
easily assimilate useful information and have an overview of the attractions, accommodation, facilities.
- The first page will consist of a large hero image amd an animated welcome sign will appear after loading page and also navigation bar which is transparent will change
 to dark after scroll so the user can see the full image first.
- The second about page will contain information about the city, the story about the dwarf and also useful information about the Polish currency and the current weather 
in Poland. At the end of the page there will be an interactive gallery of dwarf's.

**4. Skeleton**
## Wireframe mockups:
**HOME PAGE**

![althomepage](wireframes/home-page.png)

 ** HOME PAGE FINAL RESULT**

The navigation bar was initially set to be transparent. While scrolling down it suposed to turn black however, during the development
of the project I decided to keep it black at all times as transparent text was not sufficiently visible on the background image.
The welcome sign initially set as hidden and which appears after the page load and disappears after scrolling down, is now set as permanent.
 I believe it's less distracting for the user.
![althomepage](wireframes/home-page-new.png)

**ABOUT PAGE**

![altaboutpage](wireframes/about-page.png)


**ABOUT PAGE FINAL RESULT**

Initially, in the about section, there suposed to be a curency showing images with Polish coins,
which would change to tails after pressing the button, however I decided against it.
I also decided to move the weather to home page and have it as current one day weather.

![altaboutpage](wireframes/about-page-new.png)

**ATTRACTIONS PAGE**

![altattractionspage](wireframes/attractions-page.png)

**CONTACT PAGE**

![altcontactpage](wireframes/contact-page.png)

- Pages/Section: Home, About, Attractions, Contact
- Fixed footer hiding on with Social Media icons oppened in a new tab.
- Fixed navigation bar primary transparent changes to Ritch Black  as the user starts to scroll down the page 
- Menu headings and pointing to each of the 4 Pages


**5. Surface**
**Colors**
- When choosing the colors, I wanted to refer to the national white and red Polish flag. Cinnabar is the current 
color of the flag and to which I have chosen a slightly more subdued shade of white and complemented it with 
shades of black and gray, which will give a website a balanced contrast. 
- As a primary color, I have chosen the color Ritch Black FORGA 39 (0E0E10) which has some small tonal 
changes from a normal black color and it will be used for navigation bar, footer and font-color of the website. 
- As an additional color, I have chosen Cinnabar (E34234) which will be used for buttons and ON/OFF Switch 
used for reversing buttons. This color will emphasise the important buttons for contact/sentand and they will be noticed by the user immediately.
- For the background I have chosen a Lavender Gray (C7C7D1) and for text on navbar and footer 
I have chosen off-white named Cultured (F4F4F6). Both colors belong to the same color palette as 
Ritch Black FORGA 39. These colors work very well also with the images.

  ![altcolorspalette](wireframes/testing/color-palette.png)
 

 **Typography**
- For the main headings, logo "WROCLAW" and the sign "The city of Dwarfs" I selected the "Just Another Hand" 
font with the group of fall-back font of "Cursive". It will add simplicity to the website which I feel suits the overall look of the website. 
I have chosen the same font to make the favicon logo for the tab.
- For the content I have chosen "Lato" with fallback of "sans-serif", which was created by a polish designer 
and due to it's populatity this is a font that many users will be familiar with. It evokes a feeling of trust 
as well as being visually pleasing. It is a popular pairing font with "Just Another Hand"
 according to [google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Just+Another+Hand?query=just+&preview.text=WROCLAW%20The%20City%20Of%20Dwarfs&preview.text_type=custom#pairings/)


 **Images**
- The image selection has been chosen very carefuly to present the beauty of Wroclaw city and its main attraction - the Dwarfs which settled in there for good. The photos presentation shows potential tourists the attractiveness of the city
- The hero image was chosen to give the site a little bit fairy-tale character as the main attractions of this city are in fact dwarfs and overall fairy-tale scenery.
