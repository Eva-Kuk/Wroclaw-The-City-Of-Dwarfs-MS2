**Project Bugs And solutions**
---
While working on this project I encountered the following problems which I tried to solve in the following way:

1. When I tried to connect the buttons to the API map, the btn-dwarfs button showed 10 errors in the dev tool.
 The error appeared in an array where the lengths and widths were incorrectly defined, instead of specifying lat and lng as an object had an additional location parameter that was not defined as specified in the code
- SOLUTION: removing the location: property from the array

2. Issue with broken links. Navbar didn't respond didn't move to each section when clicked on individual links.
 The error apeared because I implemented the solution to close dropdown menu after selecting link on navbar on small devices
  for from my previous project which worked perfectly on earlier version of bootstrap 4.6.
  bar would collapse after selecting the link on
 - SOLUTION: removing unnecessary code
